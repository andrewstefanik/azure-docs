## Offer details

The offer details section contains the following fields:

-   Offer summary
-   Offer description

### Offer summary

The Offer summary is a brief description of your offer that appears just

examples of offer summaries together with their corresponding offer
names:

### Offer description

Enter the description of the consulting service offer here. A good offer
description covers exact details of what the engagement will look like
and what will be the end deliverable to the customer. It should clearly
help the customer understand what they get. Your offer description needs
to include how your offering relates to the Microsoft product for which
you are offering consulting services.

Do not include email links or phone numbers for contacting you in your
Offer description. There will be a **Contact Me** button with your offer
that will upload leads to the lead management target that you identify
on your offer.

You will enter the offer description in Markdown format. If you are not
familiar with Markdown or formatting for HTML, you can review resources
on the [How to use Markdown for writing Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/how-to-write-use-markdown).

Using these formats will ensure your offer has maximum readability for
customers.

Keep your Offer description brief and adhere to the character limit as
users do not like to read long text. You still have the option to
upload marketing brochures, fact sheets, and other documents that
describe your offer in deeper detail.

The following example demonstrates a well composed Offer description and
its related name and summary:

**Offer name:** Cloud Analytics: 3-Day Workshop

**Offer summary:** Overview of Microsoft Azure and Power BI, assessment
of current environment, and mini POC.

**Offer description:** This 3-day workshop is for technical and business

consulting service offerings for a single customer and, for assessment,

conducted either onsite or virtually. The AppSource consulting services

    determine applicability of a solution and provide an estimate of

    to draw customer interest using frameworks, demos, and customer
    examples. Briefings must be conducted onsite.
-   **Implementation:** A complete installation that results in a fully

    solutions that can be implemented in one week or less.

    a solution will meet a customer's requirements.
