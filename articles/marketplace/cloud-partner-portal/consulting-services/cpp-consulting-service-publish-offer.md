# Publish consulting service offer

After you complete the **Offer Settings**, **Storefront Details**, and **Contacts**,
select **Publish** and provide an email address. When Microsoft is ready
to publish your offer, you will receive an email to preview it before it
goes live. You can return to the portal to check the status of your
offer at any point in time.

Offers might appear in a "Publish canceled" or "Publish failed" status
during the publishing process. This status is a normal part of the process, and allows Microsoft to make edits to your offer. If you see your offer in
"Publish canceled", leave it in that status.

**Lead destination**

You can select a CRM system where your lead will be stored. The CRM system you select here is where we will write details of end users that try your app on AppSource (leads).
