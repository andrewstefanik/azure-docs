# Azure Active Directory B2C: User flows


The extensible policy framework of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C is the core strength of the service. Policies fully describe consumer identity experiences such as sign-up, sign-in, or profile editing. To help you set up the most common identity tasks, the Azure AD B2C portal includes predefined, configurable policies called **user flows**. For instance, a sign-up user flow allows you to control behaviors by configuring the following settings:

* Account types (social accounts such as Facebook or local accounts such as email addresses) that consumers can use to sign up for the application
* Attributes (for example, first name, postal code, and shoe size) to be collected from the consumer during sign-up
* Use of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
* The look and feel of all sign-up pages
* Information (which manifests as claims in a token) that the application receives when the user flow run finishes

You can create multiple user flows of different types in your tenant and use them in your applications as needed. User flows can be reused across applications. This flexibility enables developers to define and modify consumer identity experiences with minimal or no changes to their code.

User flows are available for use via a simple developer interface. Your application triggers a user flow by using a standard HTTP authentication request (passing a user flow parameter in the request) and receives a customized token as response. For example, the only difference between requests that invoke a sign-up user flow and requests that invoke a sign-in user flow is the user flow name that's used in the "p" query string parameter:

&p=b2c_1_siup                                       // Your sign-up user flow

```

```

```

## Create a sign-up or sign-in user flow

This user flow handles both consumer sign-up & sign-in experiences with a single configuration. Consumers are led down the right path (sign-up or sign-in) depending on the context. It also describes the contents of tokens that the application will receive upon successful sign-ups or sign-ins.  A code sample for the **sign-up or sign-in** user flow is [available here](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet-susi.md).  It is recommended that you use this user flow over a **sign-up** user flow or a **sign-in** user flow.

## Create a sign-in user flow

## Create a profile editing user flow

## Create a password reset user flow

## Preview user flows

As we release new features, some of these may not be available on existing policies or user flows.  We plan to replace older versions with the latest of the same type once these user flows enter GA.  Your existing policies or user flows will not change and in order to take advantage of these new features you will have to create new user flows.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I link a sign-up or sign-in user flow with a password reset user flow?
When you create a **sign-up or sign-in** user flow (with local accounts), you see a **Forgot password?** link on the first page of the experience. Clicking this link doesn't automatically trigger a password reset user flow. 

Instead, the error code **`AADB2C90118`** is returned to your app. Your app needs to handle this error code by invoking a specific password reset user flow. For more information, see a [sample that demonstrates the approach of linking user flows](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-SUSI).

### Should I use a sign-up or sign-in user flow or a sign-up user flow and a sign-in user flow?
We recommend that you use a **sign-up or sign-in** user flow over a **sign-up** user flow and a **sign-in** user flow.  

The **sign-up or sign-in** user flow has more capabilities than the **sign-in** user flow. It also enables you to use page UI customization and has better support for localization. 

The **sign-in** user flow is recommended if you don't need to localize your user flows, only need minor customization capabilities for branding, and want password reset built into it.
